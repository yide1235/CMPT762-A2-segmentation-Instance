# segmentation-instance
In the .ipynb file, there is two way of doing segmentation, the first approach use a fast-rcnn detection model first, then do U-Net based segmentation on detected boxes. The second one is end-to-end mask rcnn segmentation. It shows in engineering, end-to-end straining ometimes shows better accuracy.
